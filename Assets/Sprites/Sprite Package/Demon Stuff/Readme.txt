I have this idea for something about the demons/liberals in this game. I want this to be a growth that occur in the game, randomly in the first level. If the player so choses to make a deal with the demons, then this will not bother them. However, if they don't, then this growth like things will begin to grow slowly, over a section on the map. They player can gain items that cut down the growth, such as the tree cuters and flamethrower. If the growth goes to big, than it will stop doors from opening. Maybe this isn't for the demons, and maybe this will be instead for the liberal hive, still debating on that. Also, to contain its growth, you need to close all the doors leading to that room. Leaving it open will cause it spread. Also, to prevent this from being too OP, I think you should put a cap on how large it grows.
